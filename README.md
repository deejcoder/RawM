# RawM
Raw Messenger: You control your messages

RawM will allow users to control visibility of their messages sent through this messenger. They may choose if they wish to have their messages saved on one of their own servers using a future API feature, or to just keep them on their local machine. The server shall only store minimal information about each user that is absolutely vital.

TODO:
1.  Sessions: when a user logs in, the server replies with a session ID, which is stored locally and is valid for x amount of time. This will allow the user to reconnect if their connection times out.
2.  Enforce TLS for security.
3.  Organize CSS, and JavaScript with a proper structure.
4.  Implement logback/log4j
